# How to build code

## Backend (mock service)
To start the local mock server you need to do the following:

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
2. Navigate to the `\api-schema` folder
3. Run the following command: `docker-compose up -d`
4. The Mock server will be running on the port `localhost:8080`. You also will have access to the Swagger UI from the following url: `localhost:8081/swagger`

## Flutter

### Installing flutter on your environment

Please follow the instructions on the flutter.dev page to configure your local system: [flutter quick start](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

NOTE: If you are using the new Apple silicon (M1/M1Pro/M1Max or M2/M2Pro/M2Max). Be aware that you could have problems with compiling the app. Please follow the instructions which are shown in the logs.

Like:

    Error: To set up CocoaPods for ARM macOS, run: sudo gem uninstall ffi && sudo gem install ffi -- --enable-libffi-alloc

### Installing additional flutter plugins

Depending on the IDE which are you want to use please install following Flutter Intl plugins:
- [Android Studio & IntelliJ](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=localizely.flutter-intl)

#### Build flutter code

To build the code you need to the following steps:
1. Go to the file `bcapp\bildungscampus_app\lib\main.dart`
2. Check if you have configured the url to the backend server correctly (`apiGatewayUrl` property):
Depending for what platform you are implementing the settings need to be different.

For android it should be: `http://10.0.2.2:8080` (for standard google emulator)

For iOS it should be: `http://localhost:8080`

You probably also need to configure the Info.plist file:

    <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
    <dict>
        <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
            <true/>
    </dict>      

3. Run following command: `flutter run --flavor dev` or use the Visual Studio Code `Run without debugging` option in the `run` tab
